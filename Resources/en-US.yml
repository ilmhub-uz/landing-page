CommentsComponent:
  FirstComment: My favorite teacher of algorithms who never gets tired of sharing his knowledge given by Allah with young people with a smile on his face ðŸ™‚. Good luck with everything you want to do in future.
  SecondComment: I needed demanding teachers because I wouldn't study unless someone encouraged me to acquire all the time. Coming to Ilmhub, I found the teachers I was looking for.
  ExperiencedMentors: Verified Mentors
  StudentsOpinions: Feedback from students
  ThirdComment: .NET bootcamp has helped me tremendously in my career as a junior in programming because they have taught me so much in such a short amount of time. Since the classes were 5/7, 70% of my day was spent with my friends at co-working center. Through this, I learned both programming and networking.
