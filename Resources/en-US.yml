  FirstComment: Alloh bergan ilmni yuzidagi tabassumi ila yoshlarga ulashib charchamaydigan, algoritm bo'yicha sevimli ustozimðŸ™‚. Kelgusida qilmoqchi bo'lgan har bir ishingiz xayrli bo'lsin
  SecondComment: Menga talabchan ustozlar kerak edi, chunki meni kimdir doim o'qishga undab turmasa o'qimas edim. Bu o'quv markaziga kelib, men qidirgan ustozlarni topdim.

  ThirdComment: .NET bootcamp menga dasturlash sohasida junior darajaga chiqishimda juda katta yordam berdi, chunki oz vaqt davomida ko'p narsalarni sifatli tarzda o'rgatishdi. Darslar 5/7 bo'lgani uchun, kunimni 70% qismi markazdagi co-workingda boshqa do'stlarim bilan o'tdi. Bu orqali ham dasturlashni, ham networkingni o'rgandim.
